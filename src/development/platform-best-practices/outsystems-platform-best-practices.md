# OutSystems Platform Best Practices
This article aggregates a collection of best practices and conventions that might be applied when developing using OutSystems Platform. These are only recommendations and should be adapted to each environment and to each development style.

## Naming and Coding Conventions

### Standard Language

* Use English for code and comments

### Naming Conventions

* Meaningful names (e.g. "Customer" instead of “Cstr”)
* Use PascalCase
* Suffix foreign keys with “Id” (e.g. “CustomerId”)
* Include the Entity’s Name in the Record’s name (e.g. “Customer” instead of “record”)
* Group Screens with a prefix (e.g. “Customer_Edit”, “Customer_Show”)
* Prefix actions invoked byTimers with “Timer_”
* Set the Name property of ShowRecords, EditRecords and TableRecords

### Coding Conventions

* Avoid empty labels and descriptions
* Comment unclear or complex logic
* Set the example string of Expressions
* Keep Action Flows vertical and tidy
* Use Static Entities instead of hard-coded values

### Reusability

* Reuse logic with User Actions
* Reuse screen parts with Web Blocks
* Encapsulate data formatting with User Functions
* Use RefreshQuery to rerun a Query

## JavaScript, CSS and HTML

* Use Web Blocks for JavaScript encapsulation and reusability
* Make sure your JavaScript blocks are perfectly identifiable
* Comment your JavaScript
* Use cross browser JavaScript (e.g. JQuery, mooTools)
* Avoid writing custom HTML using unescaped expressions
* Avoid duplicate CSS styles
* Minify JavaScript and CSS whenever possible 

## Database

* 492 attributes in one Entity is perhaps too much :)
* Attribute with size 4000 is perhaps too much :)
* Check the Delete Rule of Foreign Keys to an Entity.
* Remember to set the Is Mandatory property
* Add descriptions at least to the Entities

## Aggregates and Advanced Queries

### Queries

* Use Aggregates: they’re optimized and database independent!
* Avoid using indexes ([i]) when iterating a Query output
* Minimize the number of Queries you need to execute
* Avoid type casts in Aggregates

### Advanced Queries

* Use Advanced Queries only when absolutely necessary
* Use Parameters instead of hard-coded values in the SQL 
* Indent SQL code consistently
* Use comments and inline comments in your SQL
* Use Advanced Queries for bulk operations
* Do not put business logic in the SQL
* Use the EncodeSQL built-in function for Inline Parameters
* Keep in mind that Advanced Queries are database specific

## Building for Change

* Favor Aggregates over Advanced Queries
* Keep in mind that Advanced Queries are harder to maintain
* Avoid creating custom HTML/Javascript
* Split functionality in different Web Screens
* Don’t use Extensions to implement business logic

## User Interface

* Move JavaScript blocks to the end of the screen
* Find out what needs improvement by observing your users
* A Preparation with more than 10 nodes normally means trouble
* Reduce the size of the eSpace’s images

## Architecture

Use a 3 layers approach:

* Business Processes: a service available for use by users or business processes
* Core Entities: logical grouping of operations per responsibility
* Connectors: extensions or integration with other systems

Also:

* Wrap Extensions in eSpaces
* Avoid circular references between eSpaces
* Clearly define the responsibilities of each eSpace
* Remove unused references Encapsulate business logic in User Actions
* Create user story driven interfaces Don't isolate the data model in one eSpace. eSpaces should be functional units instead of architectural units.
* Use asynchronous logic when possible

## Teamwork

* Know the recommended project team for your project (see [Staffing OutSystems Projects](https://www.outsystems.com/home/document-download/181/25/0/0))
* Use a single user for each team member
* Everyone in the team should use the same Service Studio version
* Use LifeTime to perform application versioning
* Avoid publishing single eSpaces: use LifeTime
* Avoid working on the same elements at the same time
* Create team processes for active log monitoring
* Create team processes for manual deployment procedures such as data update scripts
* Define what "done" means and include testing.

## Logic and Development

* Remove unused or duplicate code
* An eSpace with a size > 4 MiB normally means bad architecture
* Set at least one default button in your Web Screens
* Avoid changing Site Properties values in your logic
* Be careful about infinite recursion
* Hide warnings only for a good reason
* More than 20 site properties in one eSpace normally means bad design
* Avoid using Extensions solely for Web Service consumption
* Disable auditing of Extensions in Production

## Security

* Set the Web Screen's Roles
* Be aware of sensitive data exchange
* DON’T send sensitive information in screen parameters
* Remember: Web Screen's variables or Preparation outputs might be exposed in the URL or Viewstate
* When applicable, use SSL for sensitive information
* DO NOT rely on the Web Screen widgets interface to control permissions
* Validate user’s Roles before executing Screen Actions
* Use encrypted passwords in the database
* Use Internal Access Only for Web Flows and Web Services 

## Performance

### Data model

* Index your Entities
* Isolate large Text and Binary Data in another entity
* Beware of Large Excel Files Performance
* Make good use of the Delete Rules in Entities
* Archive old data in separate Entities

### Infrastructure

* Setup database maintenance plans
* Configure Web server memory settings
* Backup database transaction logs often
* Tune database file growth
* Apply virtual memory and system settings
* Use a dedicated server for Timers
* Prefer 64-bit architectures
* Plan and monitor timers schedule so there are no conflicting schedules

### Logic

* Look into Service Center reports
* Avoid long-running Timers and batch jobs
* Simplify screen Preparations
* Place as little information as possible in Session Variables
* Avoid using isolated Aggregates in User Actions
* Avoid using queries inside If branches in Preparation
* Avoid chained Web Service calls. Return as much as possible in a single cal

### Queries

* Don’t perform joins over linked servers
* Minimize the number of fields fetched from the database
* Keep Max Records consistent with your needs
* Iterate over queries once and avoid using indexes ([i])
* Minimize the number of executed queries

### References

* NEVER create circular references between eSpaces
* Choose wisely between Local Web Services or Public Actions
* Use Connection Pooling

### User Interface

* Avoid using Preparation data in screen actions
* Use AJAX with care - it may impact overall performance
* Use multiple Web Screens instead of creating complex ones
* Cache, baby, cache!
* Minimize Screen Parameters
* Import JavaScript files as resources
* Move JavaScript Web Blocks that are not needed at loading time to the bottom
* Use CSS Sprite Images
