# Designing the Architecture of Your OutSystems Applications

This guide builds upon the [Architecture Canvas](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Best_Practices/Architecture/Designing_the_Architecture_of_Your_OutSystems_Applications/The_Architecture_Canvas) methodology to help you through what you must consider to develop your applications with a future-proof architecture from the start.

It presents [validation rules](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Best_Practices/Architecture/Designing_the_Architecture_of_Your_OutSystems_Applications/Validating_your_application_architecture) to make sure your architecture has been correctly designed, a generic [Service-Oriented Architecture](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Best_Practices/Architecture/Designing_the_Architecture_of_Your_OutSystems_Applications/Service-Oriented_Architectures_for_OutSystems_applications), a Microservices-style implementation and different [architectural patterns](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Best_Practices/Architecture/Designing_the_Architecture_of_Your_OutSystems_Applications/Integration_Patterns_for_Core_Services_Abstraction) that reflect best practices in OutSystems application design.
