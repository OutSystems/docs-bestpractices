# Exposing your applications

An important part of designing your OutSystems Platform infrastructure is protecting your applications from external threats.

Two of the strategies you can implement are the use of **Load Balancers** and **Reverse Proxies**. Both provide high availability, SSL offloading and prevent direct contact with the Internet.

To learn about these topics in more detail, check the following guides:
